We now welcome you in six former Fletcher locations in beautiful nature, like the Veluwe and the Oisterwijk forests, and in eight city hotels near historic Dutch centers such as Amsterdam and Breda.
This spring the Veluwe is at its best: soft light, green trails, and calm evenings. 
Ideal for crews on a job nearby and for anyone who just needs a long weekend or midweek to recharge. 
Sleep well. Pay a fair price. Leave at 13:00—no rush.",
